In order to follow the course, make sure that you have an environment with Python 3 installed and the next Python packages on it:

- numpy
- scipy
- ipython
- jupyter
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- altair
- pyflakes
- pylint
- nose
- pytest
- psutil
- memory_profiler
- ipython_memwatcher
- pybind11
- cython
- numexpr
- numba
- f2py
- gcc
- tables (pytables)
- xarray
- pandas
- bcolz
- scikit-image

I recommend to use Anaconda to install most of the packages above, and for the software that is not in anaconda.org repos, just use pip, e.g.:

$ pip install ipython_memwatcher
$ pip install pybind11
$ conda install altair --channel conda-forge
$ pip install altair

Also, it is recommended to install the GCC compiler that comes with the anaconda distribution:

$ conda install gcc
